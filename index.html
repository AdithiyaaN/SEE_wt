            <h2>So Many Anime Genres!</h2> <br> <hr><br>
            <p> If you’ve been an enthusiastic watcher of anime just like me,
                then one thing you’ve come to know is that each and every show
                comes with a set of specific genres. There’s a multitude out
                there when it comes to anime—action, drama, and horror just to
                name a few. But do you even know all of them? Do you think you
                can recite all of them in one fell swoop?

                I know there are many anime genres in existence because they
                come and go every now and then. But the most popular ones become
                common enough to stay for a very long time. And so, I’ve come up
                with this anime genre list to serve as a complete guide with
                explanations and meanings for all of them.

                I’ve tried my best to make this a complete list of anime genres
                so that it can serve as your very own one-stop compendium for
                when you’re looking for a genre guide. I've provided a basic
                list of genres for easy viewing. Below that will be the genres
                with more descriptive details as well as anime that fit in that
                category. Whether you’re a diehard anime fan, a casual watcher,
                an interested onlooker, or even just a non-fan who is passing
                by, this list of anime genres shall equip you with some basic
                knowledge and help you venture through the anime world with ease
                and delight.
